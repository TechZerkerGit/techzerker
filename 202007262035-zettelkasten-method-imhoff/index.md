Stefan started Zettelkasten in 2019, and in his case found the Mac/iOS [Devonthink]() software fit his design best.

Stefan does not do regular #Tags, as his focus on Devonthink as the software, it does the equivalent of tags, but apparently smarter.

Stefans version of workflow into his Zettelkasten is to have a handful of *Inboxes* to gather rough notes, things to reference and ideas. He then generally processes the inbox once a day into useful notes.

Stefan had excellent rules listed for selecting privacy focused software.
