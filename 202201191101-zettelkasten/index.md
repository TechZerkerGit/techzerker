A zettelkasten is a type of knowledge management system (KMS), originally created by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), and popularised by the book [How to Take Smart Notes by *Sonke Ahrens*](https://amzn.to/3GJp6fT), among many other online sources and guides.

The core design of how the zettelkasten works is that no pre-defined structure or organisation is imposed, as that can limit idea and thought discovery. Instead, notes are assigned a unique [Zettelkasten ID](202201191101-zettelkasten-id.md), which digitally is most commonly (as here) based off timestamp, and then cross-linked to any other notes with related ideas. This is aided by the focus that notes should be [Atomic Notes](202201191101-atomic-notes.md). 

The *Links* section of this document is acting as a *hub note* to help identify some starting points to explore the zettelkasten, which is designed to be wandered. These links are not meant to imply rigid organisation or file structure, beyond some slight structure for rough reading notes and author tracking. By design, it is very possible to start down a chain of Linux IT notes and end up cross linking into Stoicism thoughts or any other subject as this keeps growing.
