As I was journaling tonight, I was circling on thoughts of what I need to refocus on my writing practice. The first stage of this I feel is re-approaching [Digital Minimalism (Cal Newport)](https://amzn.to/3h0T3Qv) to review my tools and usage.

To the effect of writing more, to build the habit I expect to have more ‘micro-blog’ style entries, that are more journal / stream of thought style, vs well thought/planned/edited.

As I begin my efforts on re-evaluating my tools and applications via Digital Minimalism, I aim to write about those findings and my thoughts. 

My first target as I make time in the busy days ahead will be my iPhone 13 Pro and the various apps and services I have installed. More to come!
