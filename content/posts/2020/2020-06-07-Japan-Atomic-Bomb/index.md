This story already circulated plenty in months past, but I decided to link it today after a good co-worker discussion on who writes history, and always being willing to learn facts. In our case, our discussion started with referring to *Hunting Hitler*, and understanding at the close of the war, people needed to hear **we got him!**, even if it wasn't accurate, and he was actively being searched for. The same goes for Japan in 1945, the American public, at least in the short term, needed to hear that the Atomic Bomb developed at great expense and sacrifice ended the war. This article is a great read to remind us all to read and analyze facts for ourselves, and remember who writes history.
