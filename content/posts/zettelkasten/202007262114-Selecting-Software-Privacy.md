# 202007262114 Selecting Software for Privacy

These rules are one good guideline that came out of an article on Zettelkasten, but apply in many areas. This is a rare direct copy, as it can't really be rephrased:

- Never use a tool or service which does not allow exporting my content easily.
- Never store valuable information only on an external server which might disappear or be inaccessible.
- Never use a proprietary format that is depending on a specific company or tool or is hard or impossible to convert into another format.
- If possible don’t use a service or software that doesn’t support encrypting my data.
- If possible don’t use a service or software that has a monthly fee. Monthly fees make it easy for developers to not deliver good software while the user is not being able to stop paying without losing access to the software.
