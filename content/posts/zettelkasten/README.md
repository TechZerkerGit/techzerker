# Obsidian Zettelkasten

I maintain my reading notes and knowledge base via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which is software for maintaining a Zettelkasten. This specific file is just the basic GitHub readme file, which I use to sync, and also use with [Obsidian Export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) to create these notes in my Hugo based site (where your viewing this) on [Techzerker](https://techzerker.com). 

I also use Obsidian Mobile on iOS with *Working Copy* to sync to the GitHub repo, which was [easy to setup](https://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/obsidian-ios-setup/).
