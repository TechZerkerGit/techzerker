After reading [Digital Minimalism]() several times when it was released, I looked for ways to implement the ideas presented. They ranged from minor changes to the existing smartphone all the way to the realm of no mobile device. The first serious solution I settled on was using an LTE Tablet in place of the smartphone.

## The Setup

- ZTE Grand X View 3 8” Tablet (LTE)
- Ooma VOIP Service w/Premium Plan
- Virgin Mobile Data Plan

### ZTE Tablet

The ZTE Grand X View 3 was selected, as I was targeting a budget device. I wasn’t ready to commit to the cost of an iPad Mini, and was focusing on smaller tablets to remain semi-portable. In that range, this ZTE Tablet had the highest resolution screen and more memory than most other LTE 7-8” Tablets that supported Canadian carriers. 

*Cost: $6/mo - Two Year Contract*


### Ooma VOIP Service

I shopped around for a few VOiP providers before selecting Ooma. One of my key criteria was porting my existing number. The only provider that came back with that option was Ooma. To seal that deal, Ooma offered mobile apps that would allow all calling features with their premier plan. 

*Cost: $10/mo - Paid Yearly*


### Virgin Mobile Data Plan

The selection of the carrier came down to the device selection, as I wasn’t interested in buying upfront. In this case, the core carriers all had more outdated entry level small Android tablets, for the same price that Virgin had the ZTE. In addition, Virgin had a decent offer of 4 GB data for $15/mo. At the time of purchase, other carriers were all running *scaling* tablet plans that started at $5 for 100mb, and quickly scaled to $20 for 2 GB and up. 

*Cost: $15/mo*


### Total Solution Cost

These components together formed the plan, and would double up as a budget savings vs the $75-100/mo standard smartphone plan.

*Total Cost: **$31.00/mo***


## Why Use a Tablet as a Phone?

The thought process to this solution was to maintain the benefits of the smartphone, but introduce a barrier to the *always in your pocket* easy access.

The concept being that I could still have access to apps on the go, and features like navigation.
