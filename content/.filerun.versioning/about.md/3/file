Thanks for reading *TechZerker!*


I'm Scott, a Canadian tech professional in the industry since 2005. I have been passionate about technology long before it became my profession, starting off with an Apple IIC back in the early 90's!

Over time I've evolved from a regular tech user on the windows flavor of the day, to a die-hard windows fan (including Windows Phone!). After that mess, I finally have settled comfortably into open source
and the linux world for all my needs, including gaming on Linux full time. When it comes to gaming, I am a mix between modern-ish gaming and what is best described as nostalgic gaming (late 90's and 2000's), 
which rarely counts as *retro*, at least not yet.

I created TechZerker as my source to talk about these technology, gaming and linux subjects. I have since expanded it as a personal blog to cover a variety of interests, as despite working in IT, I have a 
variety of non-IT interests from *History*, to *Stoicism*, *Classic Cars* and *Motorsports*, and more. Given my career, most of what I write about is related to technology, but felt it worthwhile
to demonstrate we're not all *hackers* or basement dwellers who live and die by a terminal.

As a final point, I am definitely concerned at the modern smartphone addiction challenges, and as I'm lifting my head up, I can't un-see a world scrolling through feeds, likes and shares with no real interaction,
so you won't find those features here, and instead I encourage genuine and intelligent discussion on topics. Here are the most common ways to reach me:
