After seeing a few blogs and sites I follow add *Reading* lists, showing what they are, have previously and would like to read, I liked the idea!
So here we are, right now, the "have read" list is short until I can scrape my memory for what has past, as I have not previously kept a written record.
The tail end of the list will be my running *wish list* in my reading and travels of books I would like to read. Hopefully maintaining a bit of an online
record will help improve my reading habit a bit! (I love reading, but tend to get distracted...)
