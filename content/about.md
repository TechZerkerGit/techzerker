Thanks for reading *TechZerker!*


I'm Scott, a Canadian tech professional in the industry since 2005. I have been passionate about technology long before it became my profession, starting off with an Apple IIC back in the early 90's!

Over time I've evolved from a regular tech user on the windows flavor of the day, to a die-hard windows fan (including Windows Phone!). After that mess, I finally have settled comfortably into open source
and the linux world for my needs, including gaming on Linux full time. When it comes to gaming, I am a mix between modern-ish gaming and what is best described as nostalgic gaming (late 90's and 2000's), 
which rarely counts as *retro*, at least not yet.

I created TechZerker as my source to talk about these technology, gaming and linux subjects. I have since expanded it as a personal blog to cover a variety of interests, as despite working in IT, I have a 
variety of non-IT interests from *History*, to *Stoicism*, *Classic Cars* and *Motorsports*, and more. Given my career, most of what I write about is related to technology, but felt it worthwhile
to demonstrate we're not all *hackers* or basement dwellers who live and die by a terminal. Despite these linux leanings, I am also a happy iOS/Apple user, as I also believe in the core philosiphy of *use what works for you*.

As a final point, I am definitely concerned at the modern smartphone addiction challenges, and as I'm lifting my head up, I can't un-see a world scrolling through feeds, likes and shares with no real interaction,
so you won't find those features here, and instead I encourage genuine and intelligent discussion on topics. Here are the most common ways to reach me:

## Site Navigation

A few short notes about some of the sections on this site, beyond the main regular posts and articles:


### Blogroll

As was common in the earlier days of the web, when it was more open and less platform centralized, I've added a *Blogroll* page. The Blogroll is a quick listing of various blogs and other sites I follow and find
interesting. The intent from the era of Blogrolls is if you come my way because of something I wrote, you can organically see others I follow, and find other similar interests without an algorithm telling you who (
is most profitable) for you to see or follow. As I find other writers and organizations that interest me, I'll update the Blogroll with new entries, and likely write a post about any new additions to highlight them.


### Links

The links section I added was originally going to be just a flat page of interesting websites and content, but that was going to be too similar to the Blogroll. In my usage, it is a focus on one specific *category*, as far
as how the site is designed, of posts. When I find an interesting article that I want to share, where most would re-share, with or without commentary, to a service like Facebook or Twitter, I write a short couple sentances on 
why I'm sharing this link, as a regular post. The *Links* page is just a filtered list of all that type of content, to make it easy to seperate from anything written directly by myself. It's a good section to just browse if your
looking for a wider range of material than just my own writing!


### Reading

Inspired by a few other blogs I follow, I liked the idea of having a basic public reading list, as another way to share and collaborate. It makes for an easy location to show what I am currently reading, what I have read in the past
(although that will take time to backfill!), and also a collection of all the "want to read" selections that I'll add to as I see recommendations elsewhere. If it helps encourage me to improve my reading habits, great! Otherwise, if it
helps you expand your own reading lists or discover new authors to follow and support, that is the ultimate goal. Where I can, my intention on the reading list is to link out as often as possible, to non-Amazon stores where you can find
many of these books, not necessarily to be *anti-amazon*, but at least to give some exposure to competitors and give them a fighting chance vs. the gorilla in the book-selling room.

## Privacy & Advertising

As part of operating this site, originally started via Write Freely and it's ideals, it has no Likes, Hearts or Quick Shares. You can contact me above for a genuine discussion.

For privacy, it has no identity tracking or data gathering mechanisms. I use Duck Duck Go's tools and regularly check my own site to make sure I have not unintentionally violated this.

The only type of advertising you will ever find here will be direct *old fashion* [referral links](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7975115) in plain text. These links will only be present if it flows 
well with the writing as to not disrupt the reading experience. If any of those referrals ever actually turn a profit, I will always make sure a portion goes back to donations to open source projects like WriteFreely.org.
